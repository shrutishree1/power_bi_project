**What’s there in the dashboard**:
        
        1. On the left side of the dashboard, we have 3 slicers –
                • Year slicer
                • Quarter slicer
                • Month slicer
          Through which we can navigate directly to particular time period. This is helpful in that case.

        2. Adjacent to slicers, we have 2 cards which show us the total volume sold of the
           time period which we select from the slicer and the total volume sold till 2023   
           (this is not affected by slicer).
---
        3. We have Yearly, Monthly, Quarterly and Daily Trends available to see the high,
           low, open & close prices. This is useful for monitoring the past trends.
---
        4. We have sum of total volume sold by year and month. This helps us to know the
           number of shares sold yearly and on monthly basis.
---
        5. We have the difference in High-Low & Close-Open prices to get a view of what is
          happening with the share prices on the daily basis.
